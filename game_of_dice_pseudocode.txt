2.	* Game of Dice							
3.	*									
4.	* This program randomly selects two numbers from 1 - 6 (just like rolling two dice).	
5.	* Show the dice rolls. It also shows the running score.				
6.	* Prompts the user to either roll again or lose their turn.			
7.	* A player scores the sum of the two dice thrown and gradually reaches a higher score as they continue to roll
8.	* If a single number 1 is thrown on either die, the score for that whole turn is lost. However a double 1 counts as 25.
9.	* When the score reaches 100 (or more) the game ends.
