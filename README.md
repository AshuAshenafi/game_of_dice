"#The program randomly selects two number from 1 to 6 just like rolling two dice. Show the dice rolls. It also shows the running score. Prompts the user to either roll again or lose their turn. A player scores the sum of the two dice thrown and gradually reaches a higher score as they continue to roll. If a single number 1 thrown on either die, the score for that whole turn is lost. However, a double 1 counts as 25. When the score reaches 100 or more the game ends."
